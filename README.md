Do you have your own meteo station based on Arduino or Mbed? and ever wondered how meteorologists get values like:
- Humidex
- Dew point
- Beaufort wind scale
- Wind chill
- Heat index
- Apparent temperature
- Cloud height base
- Relative pressure

Let's add them to your project. You don't need any special sensors, it's just a math. Here is a class that do that for you. Supports both **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit**.
